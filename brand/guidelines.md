# Brand Guidelines 

## vyvn :100:
Vyvn should be displayed in all lowercase unless used at the beginning of a sentence. If possible, vyvn should be displayed in all lowercase on flyers and promotional items. Vyvn can be displayed in all uppercase if the promoter/flyer is displaying all artists and groups in uppercase.

## Party Titles :tada:
```
vyvn #[number] - Name of Event
```
vyvn in all lowercase followed by a space, a `#` and the number for the event. The name for the event is in [title case](http://grammar-monster.com/lessons/capital_letters_title_case.htm). These two sections are separated by ` - `.

**Correct Examples:**
```
vyvn #3 - Precompression
vyvn #4 - The Jáden
```
        
**Incorrect Examples:**
```
Vyvn #3 - Precompression
vyvn - Precompression
vyvn #3 - precompression
vyvn #5 - Name Of Event
```

These descriptions should be the same across social media (Eventbrite, Facebook, etc).
